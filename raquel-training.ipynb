      "[\"Erik Erikson's seminal work on Psychosocial Theory had received widespread recognition as a valuable input on understanding human development in the academe. However, among his stages of development, generativity, and stagnation delves not just into the individual but also into the relationship of people to society which heralds at the end of early adulthood, approximately from ages 40-65. Generativity which refers to the notion of giving back to the society, is characterized by being a productive citizen and establishing involvement in community activities and organizations. In a general sense, Erikson emphasized that achieving generativity would lead to the feeling of usefulness, accomplishment, and satisfaction that would result in successful aging. In contrast, difficulty, or failure to achieve a sense of generativity would lead to stagnation which would yield on the feeling of loss, isolation, and disconnection from the community. In the status model by Bradley (1997), stagnant individuals are characterized by low involvement and generally low inclusivity. This is manifested by having a low investment of personal energy in work, having no interest in political or social movements, does not exhibit a sense of responsibility to promote the growth or well-being of the community, lacking knowledge about what young people need, and being unsupportive or indifferent to the youth choices and direction. Thus, in a broad description, a stagnant individual seems truly stuck on the mere idea of survival, having no interest in society and having little satisfaction with oneself.This study will probe into the social stagnation experienced among the LGBTQIA+ community. The researchers choose the LGBTQIA+ community as the focus of the study to provide a clear picture and representation of their struggles on being accepted and recognized in the society for being 'gay'. As emphasized in the article of Pereira and Banerjee (2021), people belonging to the LGBTQIA+ are more exposed to adversity, stigma, marginalization, discrimination, and less social support and therefore become at risk of having unhealthy well-being and community isolation. The same dilemma of prejudices was also experienced by LGBTQIA+ communities in the Philippines. In the article of Manalastas, Muyargas, Docena & Torre (2022), it reiterates that Filipino public attitudes towards same-sex sexualities are moderately tolerant only at the surface. It is because there is still a highly negative perception existing especially on issues involving same-gender dating, same-sex marriage, and gender transitioning. Aligned with the UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals, this research aims to look at how 'Paglingap’ (literally means providing care) can be used as a transformative approach to further integrate members of LGBTQIA+ on the society. With the goal of promoting social inclusivity and generativity, the researchers will explore how this Filipino value could mitigate social stagnation among the LGBTQIA+ community. Paglingap, which came from the word lingap (or care), was based on the traditional Filipino culture of communal cooperation to provide care and help to people in need. In the context of this research, Paglingap will be used to denote community-based, grass-root approaches and initiatives that are used to alleviate social issues and help disadvantaged people regardless of age and gender orientation.  This endeavor would be significant not only to ensure community involvement but also to provide a framework on how Filipino values can address Filipino concerns and issues in the society.\", \"Educators require continuous professional growth to keep up with changing educational demands of the global workforce of the twenty-first century. Additionally, they must demonstrate a willingness to investigate and learn about novel technological advancements that could improve and broaden educational opportunities. Faculty development has become a crucial component in achieving an effective reform of graduate education.

The first proposed study would like to assess the level of research skills of BulSU Hagonoy faculty members in order to identify appropriate capacity building initiatives that would motivate and encourage them to conduct research.The traditional definition of research includes both extension and research activities (Anderson 2007).

In line with this, rooftop planting had been an effective way for most people to grow their plant and even vegetables. However, the chalanges still remain in watering the plants.
